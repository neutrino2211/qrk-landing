We're a small team of engineers working across web development, cybersecurity, and software infrastructure. Our backgrounds cover frontend design, backend systems, security tooling, and data processing. We care about clean interfaces, stable architecture, and practical solutions that actually scale.

Collectively, we've built and maintained products ranging from user‑facing web apps to national‑scale systems for e‑commerce and security. We work with tools like React, TypeScript, Python, Go, and Rust, and we build things like intrusion detection systems, data pipelines, compilers, and internal automation tools.

But more than that, QRK is a technology research lab made up of IT professionals who aim to create tech solutions to improve the lives of people. This drive is fueled by a simple theory,

### TECHNOLOGY NO LONGER HELPS HUMANITY

In the last few decades, technology has enabled great leaps in the general standard of living, but it has also created new challenges and risks that threaten not just our day-to-day lives but also our communities and civilisations as a whole.

From social media, which enabled connecting with people from across the world but brought about seemingly endless tracking, surveillance, distractions, and misinformation, to the rise of artificial intelligence and automation, which have the potential to ease the lives of many but has been deployed to create misleading videos, enabling hate speech, and even leading to AI induced delusions which sometimes lead to death.

It's clear that technology alone is not enough to solve the world's problems, we need to bring back what we've lost. We need to bring back humanity.

### HOW DO WE WANT TO DO IT?

As a small team of engineers, we don't aim to change the world. We aim to create software that helps people live better lives.

Starting with small projects where the human is the focus, how they want to use it and how it can affect there lives. We aim to hardly think further than providing value under conditions that feels mutually beneficial. Good old trade and barter.

We also want to try networking with other professionals to hopefully collaborate on solutions.

Nothing is set in stone, we honestly don't know what we are doing but we want to try.
